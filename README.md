# EE4704 Hough
Hough Transform implementation for EE4704 CA2 and report.

The algorithm itself was based on a demo by Salaheddin Hosseinzadeh, available on MATLAB Central File Exchange. 

Visualization of the lines was based on an answer on Stack Overflow by rayryeng.

Visualization of Hough space was taken directly from the documentation for MATLAB's own `hough` function.

I benefited immensely from the explanation and example in an article by Socret Lee on Towards Data Science.
